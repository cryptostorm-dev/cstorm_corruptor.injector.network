It has been widely reported that the NSA's QUANTUM CIN system has a special preference for facebook URLs as a delivery vector of "shooter-triggered 304/302 redirects. We've noted this empirically in many months of close monitoring of such events., and thus we've opened this subdirectory here specifically to collate and organise the facebook payloads (*.facebook.com/net) - both http and https.

For example, here's the header metadata for the resource loaded from the 'connect.facebook.net' URL and archived here as <a href="https://github.com/cryptostorm/CorruptorInjectorNetworks/blob/master/facebook_served_injections/connect.facebook.net_all.js">connect.facebook.net_all.js</a> during a visit to ndevix.com.
